Chapter 1 - Setting up JS and Hello World

Browser contains the JavaScript Engine to run JS code

We can execute JS code without a browesr also using the node.js and deno.js is also like node.js 

Basically node.js contains an environment which is suitable to run JS code.
But in node.js there are no concepts related DOM beacause it needs the browser also for DOM manipulation. 




Chapter 2 - Variables and constants and Datatypes

Developing app is the main goal od developer and developer should make it.

We have to build a roadmap in mind or on the paper or anywhere else for how should our application works (procedure step by step).

It makes easy in the development of the app later.





Now ,

there are three types of Variables
 
 Var, const, let 

 Var  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX => Do not use

const:

const accountId = 1432234;
//If once initialized then value cannot be changed. 
//Block Scope



let: 

let accountEmail = "samk@gmail.com";
//If once initialized then value can be changed (Changable). 
//Block Scope
